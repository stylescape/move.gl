Scape Agency BV will collect certain non-personally identify information
about you as you use our sites. We may use this data to better understand our
users. We can also publish this data, but the data will be about a large group
of users, not individuals.

We will also ask you to provide personal information, but you'll always be able
to opt out. If you give us personal information, we won't do anything evil with
it.

We can also use cookies, but you can choose not to store these.

That's the basic idea, but you must read through the entire Privacy Policy
below and agree with all the details before you use any of our sites.

## Visitors

Like most website operators, Scape Agency BV collects
non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and
servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language
preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.
Scape Agency BV's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying
information is to better understand how Scape Agency BV's visitors
use its website. From time to time, Scape Agency BV may release
non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a
report on trends in the usage of its website.

Scape Agency BV also collects potentially personally-identifying
information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Scape Agency BV does
not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not
disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses
and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below. We may
also collect and use IP addresses to block users who violated our Terms of
Service.

## Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information

Certain visitors to Scape Agency BV's websites choose to interact with
Scape Agency BV in ways that require Scape Agency BV to gather
personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that
Scape Agency BV gathers depends on the nature of the interaction.
Scape Agency BV collects such information only insofar as is necessary
or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with
Scape Agency BV. Scape Agency BV does not disclose
personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors
can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat
that it may prevent them from engaging in certain Service-related activities.

Additionally, some interactions, such as posting a comment, may ask for
optional personal information. For instance, when posting a comment, may
provide a website that will be displayed along with a user's name when the
comment is displayed. Supplying such personal information is completely
optional and is only displayed for the benefit and the convenience of the user.

## Aggregated Statistics

Scape Agency BV may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to
the Service. For instance, Scape Agency BV may monitor the most popular
parts of the URL of its sites and services. Scape Agency BV may display
this information publicly or provide it to others. However,
Scape Agency BV does not disclose personally-identifying information
other than as described below.

## Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information

Scape Agency BV discloses potentially personally-identifying and
personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors
and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to
process it on Scape Agency BV's behalf or to provide services available
at Scape Agency BV's websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose
it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations
may be located outside of your home country; by using the Service, you consent
to the transfer of such information to them. Scape Agency BV will not
rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated
organizations, as described above, Scape Agency BV discloses potentially
personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only when
required to do so by law, or when Scape Agency BV believes in good faith
that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of
Scape Agency BV, third parties or the public at large. If you are a
registered user of the Service and have supplied your email address,
Scape Agency BV may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new
features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what's going
on with Scape Agency BV and our products. We primarily use our website
and blog to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this
type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support
email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it
in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support
other users. Scape Agency BV takes all measures reasonably necessary to
protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of
potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.

## Cookies

A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's
computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the Service each time the
visitor returns. Scape Agency BV uses cookies to help
Scape Agency BV identify and track visitors, their usage of
Scape Agency BV Service, and their Service access preferences.
Scape Agency BV visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their
computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using
Scape Agency BV's websites, with the drawback that certain features of
Scape Agency BV's websites may not function properly without the aid of
cookies.

## Data Storage

Scape Agency BV uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide
the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology
required to run the Service. You understand that although you retain full
rights to your data, it may be stored on third party storage and transmitted
through third party networks.

## Privacy Policy Changes

Although most changes are likely to be minor, Scape Agency BV may change
its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Scape Agency BV's sole
discretion. Scape Agency BV encourages visitors to frequently check this
page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site
after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of
such change.
